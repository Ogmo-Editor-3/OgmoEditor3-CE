# Introduction

OGMO Editor is a free, open source 2D level editor built by indie game developers for indie game developers. OGMO Editor focuses on a fast, intuitive project-based workflow to make level design as efficient and as fun as possible. Build levels using tilesets, add functionality by placing entities, decorate the stage with decals, and leverage custom metadata to jumpstart content creation for your game!

OGMO Editor strives to be platform and engine agnostic, so it saves project files and level files as human readable and easy to implement JSON files. This makes it easy for developers to add OGMO Editor into their workflow.

## About OGMO Editor

OGMO Editor was originally built in Flash by Matt Thorson, creator of Towerfall. A second version was created as a native Windows application. OGMO Editor 3 was originally built in Typescript by Matt Thorson and Noel Berry, and was used in the creation of Celeste. The OGMO Editor logo and application icons were made by Kyle Pulver.

This community edition of OGMO Editor 3 was translated into Haxe and extended by Caleb Cornett, Will Blanton, and Austin East.
